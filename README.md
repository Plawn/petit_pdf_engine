# Petit PDF Engine

This engine is based on the [petit_nodejs_publipost_connector](https://github.com/Plawn/petit_nodejs_publipost_connector) and should be used with the [petit_publipost_gateway](https://github.com/Plawn/petit_publipost_gateway).

It is based on [pdftk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-pdftk) and [pdf-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-lib/v/1.6.0), it should automaticcaly work with the publipost_gateway.

Note:

Ensure the version of the connector is compatible with the version of the gateway
